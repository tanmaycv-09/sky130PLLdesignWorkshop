# Brief Description of the Workshop
  
 This workshop was of 2 days conducted by VLSI System Design on the topic Phase-Locked Loop(PLL) IC design on Open-Source Google-Skywater 130nm. Over the course of two days this workshop explains the PLL inside out and we also have to design a PLL using certain simulation softwares (ngspice and magic). On the first day of the workshop, we are introduced to PLL and we discuss the circuitry required to design one. We discuss in depth about the individual components used and their role in operating the PLL. We also install the softwares on the first day and this concludes the first day. On the second day of the workshop, we start by preparing spice files and conducting spice simulations of individual components of the PLL. Then using these components, we create a spice file that will work effectively as a complete PLL. After this, we look into the layouts of the individual components and finally combine them to form a final PLL layout. We perform post-layout simulations on the individual components and end the day with discussion on tapeouts and Caravel.
